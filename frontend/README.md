# React sass starterkit

## Description

An opinioated frontend boilerplate for work with react and sass, using webpack as taskrunner and devserver for testing components. It uses both HMR for the react frontend, and browsersync for the css.

It also includes a small cli for scaffolding new components quickly.

The intended use for this boilerplate is to create components for frontend use, and not a fully working site out of the box.
It is building the js/css/img/fonts files that should be used with another backend of your choise (node, django, episerver etc) from an exposed component (Components, Containers).
It also have support for translations throuh i18next.

## Installation and quickstart

1. Clone the project
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run scaffold`
4. `npm start`
5. Done!

Visit [http://localhost:7001](http://localhost:7001) and look at the container and component you just created. It should autoopen when running the start command.

## CLI

The cli will scaffold a new component with scss, js, test and automatically add it to index.js and index.scss.

Create a component will both scss and classbase

    npm run new ComponentName

Container components:

    npm run new ContainerName -- -C containers

This will add a new component inside the containers folder (and also add the scss file to index.scss)

Delete a component that have been created with the cli

    npm run delete ComponentName

index.scss and index.js will be automatically updated when adding a component through the cli.

Subcomponents can be created as well:

    npm run new ComponentName SubComponentName

This will create a new component inside the first component. Subcomponents can be added as many levels down as you need.

## Internationalization

Support for multiple languages is served through [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) and can be found in the app/i18n folder

## Devserver

Use the devserver to look at your components. It is a modified version of webpack-dev-server.

Run it like this:

    npm start

And visit your list of components at: [http://localhost:7000](http://localhost:7000)

## Building css/js

For regular watch:

    npm run watch

For a fullscale watch (serverside, testserver, files):

    npm run multiwatch

For a regular build:

    npm run build

For productionbuild

    npm run build:prod

For all tests:

    npm test

For single test:

    npm test MyComponent

## Publishing static files

Will make a render to the specified folder (outputPathHtmlFolder) to simulate the devserver as a standalone app that can for instance be uploaded to amazon S3.

    npm run publish

## .frontendrc and overrides

The recommended way to change settings is by overriding the .frontendrc file that exists in internals folder.

Copy the .frontendrc file and place it in the root folder, next to webpack.config.js, then change the values to what you would need.

Current settings are:

```javascript
// All paths are relative to the application root
{
    // General
    "outputPath": "dist/static", // Where files will be placed when using watch or build
    "outputPathJsFolder": "js", // Folder for javascript
    "outputPathCssFolder": "css", // Folder for css
    "outputPathHtmlFolder": "dist/html", // Folder for html (empty will place in root)
    "webpackConfig": "./webpack.config.js", // Config used
    "appFolder": "app", // Foldername for the application
    "componentsFolder": "components", // Foldername where components will be created
    "containersFolder": "containers", // Foldername where containers will be created

    // Server
    "port": 7000,
    "rootServerTemplatePath": "/internals/templates/server/", // Templatefolder for servertemplates
    "publicPath": "/static/", // External static path, should be the same for devserver and the actual production path

    // Cli
    "rootCliTemplatePath": "/internals/templates/cli/", // Templatefolder for cli
    "scssFolder": "scss", // Folder for scss files
    "createScss": true, // Create a scss file with the component
    "createClass": true, // Create the class version of a react component
    "createPure": false, // Create the functional version of a react component
    "createIndex": true, // Create an index.js file inside the ComponentName folder
    "createData": true, // Create a ComponentName.json
    "createTest": true, // Create a ComponentName.test.js for unittesting
    "updateIndexScss": true, // Updated the default index.scss with the new component
    "updateIndexJs": true // Updated the index.js with the new component
    "rootFolder": "./", // Only used for overriding in tests
}
```

## Overriding templates

Currently all templates can be overridden, they all exists in internals/templates/cli and interal/templates/server

Recommended way is to copy the templatefolders and change the rootServerTemplatePath and rootCliTemplatePath in .frontendrc file

You can also with the same means override the devserver.css and devserver.js file that exists in rootServerTemplatePath

## Throubleshooting and support

### Using react addons? Getting trouble with multiple react loaded

Change externals to look like this in your webpack.config.js

```javascript
externals: {
    'react': 'React',
    'react-dom': 'ReactDOM',
    'react/lib/ReactTransitionGroup': 'React.addons.TransitionGroup',
    'react/lib/ReactCSSTransitionGroup': 'React.addons.CSSTransitionGroup',
},
```

And change vendor.js to:

```javascript
/*eslint-disable no-undef*/
require('expose-loader?React!react');
require('expose-loader?ReactDOM!react-dom');
require('expose-loader?React.addons.CSSTransitionGroup!react/lib/ReactCSSTransitionGroup');
/*eslint-enable no-undef*/
```

If you are running into similar problems with react loading multiple times, it might be that you need to add some more external library (especially if you are using the addons libraries).

### Using jQuery and plugins?

To use jquery and with old plugins you can with ease use the script loader for webpack (`npm install script-loader`), and add them both to vendor.js in a similar way as react is done (require the addon after you expose jquery).

```javascript
require('expose-loader?jQuery!jquery');
require('script-loader!jquery.flipster');  // Example plugin
```

### Serverside rendering

There is support to compile out the components with babel only:

    npm run ssr
    npm run ssr:watch

These components can with ease be used together with for example [Hastur](https://github.com/Frojd/Hastur) to create serverside rendering for your project.

#### window is not defined

Common problem with serverside rendering, if you are using window on pre componentDidMount, you will need to check if it exists. Preferably thou you will need to set a state in componentDidMount for it to be rendered correctly on the serverside, however just to check if window exists you can write this:

```javascript
if(typeof window !== 'undefined') {
    // do you window things here
}
```
